# Realistic Window Rain Simulation

A web-based simulation of raindrops sliding down a window with realistic physics.

## Features

- Realistic raindrop behavior:
  - Drops combine when they collide
  - Variable speeds and paths
  - Trails simulate water streaks
  - Random pauses to simulate drops getting stuck
  - Realistic acceleration
  
- Interactive features:
  - Click anywhere on the window to add raindrops
  - Fully responsive design

## How to use

1. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Click on the window to create more raindrops at that location
3. Watch as the raindrops realistically slide down, merge, and interact

## Technical Details

The simulation uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering and implements a custom physics system for the raindrops. Each raindrop has:

- Variable speed and acceleration
- Slight horizontal movement to simulate realistic water flow
- Collision detection for merging drops
- Opacity and size variations
- Trail effects

## Browser Compatibility

This simulation works best in modern browsers that support HTML5 Canvas:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
